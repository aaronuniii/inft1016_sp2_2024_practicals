<article> <h2>About my Experience</h2>        
<p>My first year at UniSa was a surreal experience, meeting new people, staying up late coding, exploring the campus and much more.</p>        

<h3>How was it?</h3>        
<p>Due to this being a big experience in everybodys life, it was very surreal as I once said, but a had mix with fun and stress.</p>        

<p>It was stressful because I was required to adapt into a new environment and to learn new things but it was also fun as I met new people along the way.</p>
